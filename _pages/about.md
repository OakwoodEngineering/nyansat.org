We're a team of students from [Oakwood High School](https://oakwoodway.org/), an independent school in [Morgan Hill, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Hill,_California).  We are designing and building a small satellite that has been [selected](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/kennedy/nasa-selects-new-round-of-candidates-for-cubesat-missions-to-station/) for orbital launch by [NASAâ€™s CubeSat Launch Initiative](https://www.nasa.gov/kennedy/launch-services-program/cubesat-launch-initiative/).

To achieve our objectives of technology demonstration and educational outreach, we will construct NyanSat, a 2U CubeSat (10 x 10 x 22 cm). Our satellite will inspire students and provide learning opportunities while contributing to the development of new and innovative space technologies.
