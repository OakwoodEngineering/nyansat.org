Oakwood School’s student-built small satellite, NyanSat, has just been selected to launch to the International Space Station as part of NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative. Notably, Oakwood was the only K-12 school chosen, alongside eight universities and one NASA space flight center. 

NyanSat, developed by students in the Oakwood Spacecraft Systems Engineering program, showcases innovative technology with plans to advance educational outreach and space technology. With groundbreaking features like an acoustic spacecraft mapping payload and cryptographic ledgers payload, NyanSat is set to push the boundaries of space exploration.
