Oakwood School expects to make live contact with astronauts aboard the International Space Station the week of April 20, 2025. This event, facilitated via amateur radio, will give students the opportunity to ask questions and learn firsthand about life and work in space. It will take place via direct radio contact as the station passes over our school.  

"Throughout the school year, we’ve been running educational activities anticipating this contact, and it’s finally here," said Dawn Lyle, Oakwood’s Elementary Technology Teacher. "We’re honored for the opportunity to connect our students with the ISS crew."

This event is made possible with support from the [Garlic Valley Amateur Radio Club](https://gvarc.net) and the [Morgan Hill Public Library](https://sccld.org/locations/morganhill/).

The conversation will be streamed live. For details and updates, visit [visitoakwood.com/space](https://visitoakwood.com/space).
